          <h2>First Graphical Game I made using Swift and Xcode</h2>
          <p>I made this particular game as a Space Invaders style game, however all my macOS code is only on my own computer as I never published anything through the App Store, they were for my own enjoyment and learning purposes.</p>
          <p>This particular game I called X-Wing Assault. </p>

          <h2>Second Graphical Game I made using Swift and Xcode</h2>
          <p>Again with this game it was not published on the App Store, just on my own personal Computer. I wrote this one to learn more about the physics and lighting styles within Swift and Xcode.</p>
          <p>I called this one Key Hunter, It is a maze style game where my character has to find his way to collect all the keys in the screen before he is able to unlock the exit door and get to the next level, I added enemies and movable blocks to hinder the hunt.</p>

          <h2>Workshop Manual I made using Swift and Xcode</h2>
          <p>I wrote this small App to help me with my other passion, Restoring our Classic Porsche. I had the PDF of the manual but it was difficult to find the sections I wanted quickly, so I created the App to allow me to jump to a particular section and find the info quicker</p>
          <p>Workshop Manual is as the name suggests, a workshop manual for the Porsche 928. I allows me to jump directly to the section I want then to scroll though the PDF without having to scroll endlessly to find what I want.</p>

          <h2>Codecademy's end of course assignment for Learn Python3 Certificate</h2>
          <p>After enrolling in <a id="cc" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> Pro my first course was Learn Python3, which included a final assignment to write a small game of your choice to run in the terminal. I wrote it using Visual Studio Code and Syder  </p>
          <p>I chose to adapt a trivia game I made in Swift last year that I called Stupid Ways. This is also an adaptation of the original card game called Stupid Deaths. This is a very small game that asks a set of 5 questions and determines whether you Win(5 out of 5), Pass(3 or 4 out of 5) or Fail(1 or 2 out of 5).</p>

          <p>After finishing the skill path in <a id="cc" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> for Build a website using HTML, CSS and Github Pages, I made a website for my Wife (a Florist). I wrote it using Visual Studio Code and Github.</p>
          <p>I made a multi page website that is essentially my Wifes Portfolio, not unlike this particular website which I also wrote. </p>
