            <p>Back in 2018 I began looking into programming in the Swift language, I did a few tutorials on line and finally found a guy that had a great library of both books and tutorials on the subject <a href="http://www.hackingwithswift.com"><em>Hacking With Swift</em></a>.
                I originally began by following one of his books, <em>Hacking with iOS</em>, and had a blast learning from it. However because of not wanting to publish any work to the apple app store and not being able to share the things I did
                with family or friends, I soon gave up... For a while. 
            </p>
            <p>Then in 2019 I picked it back up again and began buying, reading, watching and learning how to program in Swift and Xcode once again, this time focusing on the macOS. I followed countless tutorials on line and in the books that I got from <a href="http://www.hackingwithswift.com"><em>Hacking With Swift</em></a>,
              and after a while I began to get enough confidence to write my own games and code. Still not publising on the apple store, but able to run them from my own computer and show them off from there, I wrote quite a few little games and utility apps.</p>
            <p>The following are a small part of my work that I have done using the language.</p>

              <h3>Solo Mission</h3>
            </div> <!--ph3-->
            <div class="p port">
              <p>I built this game by modeling it off one of the tutorials I did, I changed its appearance, and screen architecture as well as the physics and movements of the enemy fighters. But all in all it was a great first real game and I loved playing it, and occasionally still do.</p>

              <p>This was my first game that I built that was my own idea, I utilized all that I have read and used in the books and tutorials up to this point. Again I was trying to learn and focus on game physics and character interactions</p>

              <h3>Porsche 928 Workshop Manual</h3>
            </div> <!--ph3-->
             <div class="p port">
              <p>This was my first attempt at making an app that I thought would be useful, in otherwords, not a game. I have a Classic 1986 Model Porsche 928 that I am restoring and I have a PDF of the entire workshop manuals that takes forever to try and find the sections and page numbers I'm looking for, so
                I designed this app to help with that. I made it so that the manual was split up into its components and added links to enable quick access to whatever I am looking for.
