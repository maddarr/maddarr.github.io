          <div class="p port">
            <p>Back in 2018 I began looking into programming in the Swift language, I did a few tutorials on line and finally found a guy that had a great library of both books and tutorials on the subject <a href="http://www.hackingwithswift.com"><em>Hacking With Swift</em></a>.
                I originally began by following one of his books, <em>Hacking with iOS</em>, and had a blast learning from it. However because of not wanting to publish any work to the apple app store and not being able to share the things I did
                with family or friends, I soon gave up... For a while. 
            </p>
            <p>Then in 2019 I picked it back up again and began buying, reading, watching and learning how to program in Swift and Xcode once again, this time focusing on the macOS. I followed countless tutorials on line and in the books that I got from <a href="http://www.hackingwithswift.com"><em>Hacking With Swift</em></a>,
              and after a while I began to get enough confidence to write my own games and code. Still not publising on the apple store, but able to run them from my own computer and show them off from there, I wrote quite a few little games and utility apps.</p>
            <p>The following are a small part of my work that I have done using the language.</p>

              <p>This was my first attempt at making an app that I thought would be useful, in otherwords, not a game. I have a Classic 1986 Model Porsche 928 that I am restoring and I have a PDF of the entire workshop manuals that takes forever to try and find the sections and page numbers I'm looking for, so
                I designed this app to help with that. I made it so that the manual was split up into its components and added links to enable quick access to whatever I am looking for.

              <p>After playing around with Swift and Xcode, this last year I decided to take it further with the coding and I enrolled in an online training program called <a href="http://www.codecademy.com"><em>Codecademy</em></a>. I began by learning the Python language and how to use the Command Line to help utilize the language. </p>
              <p>The following is part of the final assignment for the certification, in which I had to create a small game that would run in the terminal. I called it Stupid Ways, and it was designed with a card game called Stipid Deaths in mind, where you are given a senario of a persons death and you have to decide whether or not it was a true account or false</p>

              <p>Once I had finished the Python3 certification, I began to look into what other courses were available. I found one that would send me down the path Im on now. Front End Engineer. Within this career path I have now achieved certifications in HTML, Basic and Intermediate
                CSS and have begun Java Script. </p>
