						<h3>Hi, my name is Terry</h3>
				  	</div>
				  	<div class="contact-about-text">
						<p>I'm originally from Australia but after meeting and marrying a great American Lady, I migrated to the USA in 2004. Since then I've worked in many fields and learned a great deal more about the world and different ways of life. I enjoy seeing new and different parts of this country together with my wife and children.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Back in 2018 I began my coding path by looking into programming in the Swift language, by following books and online tutorials. This went on for a while however because of not wanting to publish any work to the apple app store and not being able to share the things I did with family or friends, I soon gave up... For a while.</p> 
						<br />
						<p>Roughly a year later I picked it back up again and began playing around with Swift and Xcode once more to refresh my skills. Then this last year I decided to take it further with the coding and I enrolled in an online training program called <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I began by learning the Python language and how to use the Command Line to help utilize the language. Once I had finished the Python3 certification, I began to look into what other courses were available.</p>
						<br />
						<p>I found one that would send me down the path I'm on now, the Front End Engineer Career Path. Within this career path I have now achieved certifications in HTML, Basic and Intermediate CSS and Basic Java Script. And I look forward to what this line of study can produce in the future.
