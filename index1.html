            <h2>About</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I grew up on a farm in South East Australia and did all the things any farmer would do, from riding horses, raising and milking cattle to cutting and baling hay. </p>
          <p>After school I completed an apprenticeship as a <em>Boilermaker and SSF</em>, worked in different parts of Australia doing that, then decided to return to school and got an <em>Advanced Certificate in Horticulture</em> through the University of Melbourne (Aust).I worked in different feilds of Horticulture, growing Beans in NSW, Hydroponic Tomatoes and Canteloupes in Victoria and was an Assistant Store Manager
            for a major Retail chain (Bunnings Aust.) overseeing the Garden Department as one of my duties. After I met my wife (she is a FLorist) I made the move to the USA. Since then I have been an ASM for the Home Depot, a Supervisor for Quality Control (This was cool, I was a weld inspector for a company that supplied panels for some of the new military ships coming out of Mobile, AL built by AUSTAL) and finally made my way to working for the USPS</p>
          <p>My hobbies iclude working on our classic '86 Porsche 928, building models, but my main passion right now is learning how to write code, especially web design and Front End work. I am currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> studying the career path for <em>Front End Engineer</em>.</p>
